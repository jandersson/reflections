What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created wherever I called the init command. I need to git init because that instantiates a repository and allows me to start committing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a logical directory that sits between the working directory and the repository. It is analagous to a buffer and allows commits to be prepared before being executed, minimizing mistakes.
